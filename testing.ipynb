      "|WELLS FARGO & COMPANY             |Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response|Closed with explanation        |10222910    |Wells Fargo engaged in yet another wrongful foreclosure procedure. Their attorneys XXXX XXXX XXXX led by XXXX XXXX have engaged in a plethora of frauds against my homestead and the court. We have continuously claimed the home was paid off and Wells Fargo has yet to produce any of the requested information. Wells Fargo filed for foreclosure in XXXX and did not complete the foreclose process until XXXX. The company and its attorneys engaged in dishonest unethical legal strategies to foreclose on my homestead. Wells Fargo intentionally failed to contact for years and never provided copies of any pleading. They intentionally failed to serve me regarding court hearings and summarily got a default judgement against my homestead without me knowing a hearing had occurred. I am now being forced to file bankruptcy to save my home. We are currently filing car complaints against all the attorneys involved as they engaged in fraudulent behavior by filing false certificates of service for example. All allegations can be substantiated simply by examine the case history. I believe the bank wrongfully foreclosed on my home as they have a history of this behavior. I am now a victim and seek justice to rectify this matter. Please review the Bill of Review filed and it clearly summarizes many of the wrongdoings by Wells Fargo and attorney XXXX XXXX located in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I experienced the same things Wells Fargo was just sued for by the government. The property is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX TX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Consent provided         |N/A              |2024-09-23T12:00:00-05:00|2024-09-23T12:00:00-05:00|Struggling to pay mortgage                                 |Mortgage|TX   |Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure|Conventional home mortgage                |Web          |Older American|Yes   |78244   |\n",

      "|Freedom Mortgage Company          |Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response|Closed with explanation        |10213760    |Hi, On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail from \" Freedom Mortgage Corporation '' letting me know they will be collecting all mortgage payments after XX/XX/XXXX. The letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX. There is a problem with the chronology of these dates and request. Furthermore it appears the Freedom Mortgage Corporation is not allowing me to pay them via automatic bank payments which I use for all my bills. \\n\\nAs a result I will now have to communicate with the old mortgage company XXXX XXXX, XXXX to cancel/request a return of a payment that was already sent to them after XX/XX/XXXX. And then I must call Freedom Mortgage Corporation to find out why they are not allowing my bank checks to be used for their payment. This is unacceptable to mortgage holders inheriting Freedom Mortgage Corporation. \\n\\nThank you in advance for your attention and advise.

      "|Shellpoint Partners, LLC          |Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law                       |Closed with explanation        |10171606    |In XXXX, XXXX, I obtained a mortgage loan on a new house from XXXX XXXX XXXX, which immediately transferred the loan to another mortgage company, Specialized Loan Services ( SLS ). I set up automatic payments of the full amount due, {$2600.00}, which were paid no later than the XXXX of the month ( I don't receive my retirement account distribution until the XXXX, and sometimes it is delayed a day or two because of weekends or holidays ). In XXXX, XXXX I believe, SLS merged with Newrez, which took over my mortgage.This caused a problem that resulted in a negative comment on my credit report - my score for all three reporting agencies had been around XXXX or higher until this event occurred, now it is under XXXX and adversely affecting my ability to refinance with a better interest rate. Rather than deducting {$2600.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX Newrez attempted to withdraw {$2900.00}, which is {$240.00} more than the correct mortgage amount. Since I had not been notified of the difference, I had not covered the additional amount in my checking account, and the transaction was declined. From what I can see, on XX/XX/XXXX, my bank ( XXXX ) paid Newrez the {$2900.00}. However, from the Newrez point of view, since they had refunded the automatic withdrawal transaction without notifying me in a meaningful way, I had not paid my mortgage. From my point of view, I had paid my mortgage on time, even though I had paid {$240.00} more than I was required to pay. It is my understanding that when a mortgage is transferred, the new company is not allowed to charge a different amount for the mortgage than was previously paid. I of course will immediately make this current, but I believe this was due to an error in communication- it was not an attempt to make a late payment. Nevertheless, this adverse comment on my credit reports has caused a significant drop in my credit score, something that has been consistently very high until Newrez charged me the wrong amount and then reported that I was always a month behind. I might never have noticed, except when I went to refinance my high-percentage mortgage, my mortgage consultant told me of the drop in my credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Consent provided         |N/A              |2024-09-19T12:00:00-05:00|2024-09-19T12:00:00-05:00|Trouble during payment process                             |Mortgage|VA   |Payment process                                                                                                                                  |Conventional home mortgage                |Web          |Older American|Yes   |22902   |\n",

      "|LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC      |Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response|Closed with explanation        |10224510    |it started with XXXX charging me double for insurance coverage to the tune of {$6000.00} and i'm yet to receive refund. I called them months ago and they realized the error of over 2 years of overpayment of my insurance. They advised me I would receive a refund that was months ago. Instead of giving me a refund they have increased my mortgae amount to XXXX of my origival mortgage payment amount. Additionally, I went to pay my mortgage and the amount has increased from {$1400.00} to {$2300.00} per month due to this double charge. when I called to inquire about the drastic increaseI was told that my case was with corporate and that someone would reach out to me. Customer service also told me that they couldn't help me because of the fact that my case was with corporate. That has been weeks and no one has reached out to me and I know they will be charging me a late fee and I don't agree with that. They have also consistently charged me late fees even though their website prevents me from making a payment. I'm now at risk of losing my house due to the unfair and illegal practices of this company and nothing is being done about it. I need a resolution. They have been overcharging me for 2 years and im yet to receive a resolution and this is causing undue stress and hardship

The double book keeping system for every entry we have a debit and a credit of equal value. Every transaction is required to have a debtor and creditor to balance it out. The asset on the books has a equal liability. The morgagey takes the position as the creditor by issuing me a check. The bank never told me that I was the one who funded that check by issuing me the credit thru the note in the first place. The bank is hiding that part of the transaction from me. I was paying as the debtor that side of the transaction. I am not receiving as the creditor this is not a fully functioning bookkeeping system operations. We need to correct that. Unfortunately we signed a agreement to make payments on the surface is a contract .Sounds like fraud to me. The contract was based on fraud so its null and void. The note that I created when I signed the note for the mortgage created funds on a ledger in an account. I am going to liquidate this account. I am the creditor not you. I need to receive the compensation for that. I received the loan but I did not get the money for the credit that I issued. This process has tax issues like tax publications 334 which is tax guide for small businesses I am looked at as a sole proprietor by the Irs in this business that I created. The business I created was I issued credits and I should be receiving payments. Title 26 usc 671-679 grantors and others who were treated as owners. This is based on law and tax policies by the Irs. I am the owner of the note in docourse and I am claiming my asset.

My auto-payment was not drafted out of my account so I manually paid the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the auto-payment was drafted and so I effectively double-paid. I called Shellpoint and asked for the second payment to be returned to me given the double payment and this request was submitted for approval. The Shellpoint representative confirmed that they saw the XXXX payments and that the refund request for the second payment was legitimate. \\n\\nAfter not hearing back, I called back later in XXXX - XXXX this point, I was told the refund request was still being processed. I was led to believe I could allocate the second payment to XXXX if the refund did not get processed. \\n\\nShellpoint attempted to draft my XXXX payment, which I asked my bank to put a stop payment on as I had already paid for XXXX. \\n\\nBeginning on XX/XX/XXXX, I began to receive emails that I was now 2 months behind on my mortgage - XXXX and XXXX - despite having spoken to Shellpoint who confirmed receipt of XXXX payments in XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called again to inquire about my loan status. I was told that the second payment I had sent was still not-allocated due to my refund request. I was requested to provide a bank statement showing the double payment in XXXX and that showed I did not receive a refund for the second payment. I provided this information as requested. \\n\\nI followed up on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told the issue was actually an allocation between principal and interest and that once the allocation issue was resolved, that my account would reflect properly. The representative I spoke to confirmed that there were XXXX payments received in XXXX and that they were not allocated, and upon the processing team updating the account my account would reflect accurately. \\n\\nI followed up on XX/XX/XXXX - This time, I received new information. I was told that my initial payment from XXXX was not reflecting for the XXXX payment due to an error in the principal and interest calculation from the prior servicer. I confirmed that my loan was current as of XX/XX/XXXX and that after an audit of my loan, I was NOT going to get credit for my XXXX payment that I made. This is an XXXX only loan for which I made my monthly payment as contractually obligated. Shellpoint is not giving me credit for the payment that I made. This is the first conversation I had with a Shellpoint representative where I was told I was not getting credit for my XXXX payment either. \\n\\nSecondly, they indicated that I was not being credited for the second payment that I made in XXXX as they indicated the funds did not settle correctly. I referenced the bank statement that I previously provided showing that XXXX payments were taken out of my account in XXXX and the representative indicated they would forward my information to the payment processing team. \\n\\nIt has now been nearly XXXX  months and I am not getting credit for the XXXX  monthly payments that have been made on my account and Shellpoint is misrepresenting my account as being past-due as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Consent provided         |N/A              |2024-09-03T12:00:00-05:00|2024-09-03T12:00:00-05:00|Trouble during payment process                             |Mortgage|TX   |Payment process                                                                                                                                  |Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC)|Web          |NULL          |Yes   |78746   |\n",

On XX/XX/year> I made my mortgage payment {$1700.00} through Carrington XXXX Pay application, Following day on XX/XX/year> Carrington Mortgage removed this application and announce launch of new app..\\n\\nTwo months later I found out that my payment never went through, I have history of 15 years of loan payment with never missed payment This action appears to be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681 ( 5 ) and 15 USC 1692c.\\n\\nDespite my repeated attempts to resolve this matterthrough multiple phone calls and emails beginning in the month od XX/XX/year> when I noticed change on my credit report Carrington MTG has failed to remove the inaccurate information from my credit report.

Underwriters rejected saying dormer income. \\non XX/XX/XXXX talked with XXXX XXXX ( assigned Mortgage officer ) who went over rates and the lowest was on website 4.375 % with 10 % down on XXXX arm so I did 3rd application and went over all numbers with XXXX XXXX with XXXX ( 10 % ) down and we were waiting for appraisal. on Monday ( appraisal financing contingency expired, so seller granted me extension till XX/XX/XXXX on financing ). application resubmitted and denied \" adverse information. XXXX XXXX would not followup and had the first application resubmitted as the amount was XXXX and 6 %! that is not the rate she told me and what was online. \\nSo I called her supervisor XXXX XXXX who would not return my calls. \\non Tuesday morning emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX the numbers incorrect and this is Lending discrimination. We were approved with the same income XX/XX/XXXX to purchase a house XXXX XXXX and all rents were used ( 75 % of XXXX ) and we had to submit tax returns, 3 months bank statements, and all 5 leases ( which were accepted income ). We also were given the correct rate on prior approved loans. NFCU has had lawsuits on underwriting discrimination and know we are victims. All of our savings is in Navy Federal Credit Union and it is over {$300000.00}. After finally talking to XXXX at XXXX on Tuesday ( after 4 emails begging to talk to her ) she says the file marked closed and rejected because of XXXX. the system shows XXXX loan and 5 % down and rate 6.1 %. She saw the rate online which I screenshot and emailed we can put upto 20 % down. We also just got the appraisal in at XXXX so now contract price has to be lowered. So she said there was nothing she could do and stated she could not get into the file. The rate is wrong being inputed by the UW, the amount is wrong, and the product is wrong. So I emailed XXXX XXXX ( ccd Corporate VPs found on XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nThe email listed all of our joint income is {$18000.00} a month, XXXX my Grandson ( if he needs to be added ) and all the expenses on each property. We have over {$300000.00} in NFCU savings, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( over XXXX min ), and 2 properties with no mortgage. NET worth about XXXX and this is extreme discrimination for a loan of only XXXX when we have that much in savings! our XXXX is XXXX and the cap on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXs XXXX. My daughter XXXX XXXX used to work for XXXX 28 years, she did the calculations and said NFCU is violating \" The Fair Housing Act ( FHA ) 1. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) 2. The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) 3. '' she told me that if they dont give us the loan to take all our moeny out and close accounts because this is Overt Discrimination, Disparate Treatment and Disparate Impact. \\n\\nTuesday evening after cc Corporate VPs XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, a liaison called XXXX XXXX. She pulled up denied application and stayed on the phone 90 minutes going over calculations and it did not make sense. the wrong rate was put in and the downpayment still showed 5 %. New information about the gap in rental income XXXX I had to email her Building plans and the 1 time Capital improvement, those costs were deducted from rental income. So the UW did not know that and I emailed XXXX as the file was closed not allowing us to upload new information. \\nThey were suppose to send us Conditional approval stating loan could be done if more down, or if pledge loan paid off or any information what to do to continue. They just closed the file and rejected us and they never did that before. it was an unwarranted and violation to us. my Grandfather was a member, my mother was a member, my daughter and grandchildren member so we dont understand the grounds of denial. \\nI get 2 pensions directly from the government every month XXXX and my daughter SSD XXXX, I even offered the auto payment directly out of XXXX account is XXXX! We get XXXX every month regardless to rents so there is no risk! Wednesday afternoon me & XXXX went over all the numbers : XXXX pensions XXXX SSD XXXX ( suprvr UW approve 75 % of leases rent income XXXX XXXX ) XXXX income XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX insurance taxes hoa XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ins hoa * NO MORTGAGE XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX tax + ins * NO MORTGAGE SALE PRICE IS NOW XXXX 10 % XXXX LEAVES {$320000.00} YESTERDAYS RATE 4.625 % no discount points XXXX could not get UW to approve, they keep putting 6.1 % a higher rate ( which is usually done to applicants with bad credit ) **THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE UW PLUGGING IN WRONG NUMBERS ON PURPOSE SO WE GET HIGHER PAYMENT AND DTI WRONG THE PAYMENT SHOULD BE {$1100.00}. \\nTHEN XXXX XXXX  {$1300.00} ( WHICH WILL BE SOLD IN XXXX AND WE WILL PAYOFF THIS LOAN OR JUST REFI INTO A VA LOAN IN 6 MONTHS THIS WILL BE PAID OFF ) DEBT : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -- -- -- -- XXXX debt to income {$15000.00} x XXXX XXXX {$4400.00} NFCU must re-underwrite the last application since there is new information and this extenuating circumstance is present. Lending discrimination occurs when a credit decision is based on factors other than the applicant 's creditworthiness. THIS FEELS LIKE LENDER DISCRIMINATION. THE AMOUNT WE ARE ASKING FOR IS IN OUR SAVINGS. WE DID NOT WANT TO PAY CASH AND HAVE NO SAVINGS. \\n\\nIF HEAD UW APPROVES RATE 10 % DOWN AT 4.625 % THE LOAN SHOULD BE APPROVED TODAY. \\n\\nIF NFCU refuses to re work the application, then NFCU will get fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm to the lender.
